supplementary to each other thus Container Shipping Lines cannot transport cargo if containers
are not available. In order to fulfill the demand and satisfy the lessee to lease the container in
the efficient way this application is developed. Generally, container shipping companies
reposition empty containers from surplus ports to deficit ports. As a result, obviously, there is
a cost involved in balancing the container fleet by respective shipping lines. The available
containers are uploaded to this application by the lessor (owner), and he specifies all the details
like container history, container type, and container id and container rate per year. A truck
trailer body that can be detached from the chassis for loading into a vessel, a rail car or stacked
in a container depot. Containers may be ventilated, insulated, refrigerated, flat rack, vehicle
rack, open top, bulk liquid or equipped with interior devices.
